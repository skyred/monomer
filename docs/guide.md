# Guide to Building Drupal Themes with Web Components (Polymer based)

## Wrapper elements vs. Blackbox elements

 - Blackbox elements are those that encapsulate everything, including styling and behaviours, and only provide a few simple arguments for input. 
 Examples include video player, responsive image, "fancy button" etc. 
 
 - Wrapper elements are those that provides acts as a wrapper of content output by other parts of the system. For example, a "region" element in Drupal might
 contain any content generated by Drupal, including nodes and blocks. Such nature means that wrapper elements cannot have too much assumption about what 
 it will contain and need to be universal, which limits what they can encapsulate. However, wrapper elements can still encapsulate styling and the "wrapping part" 
 (e.g. border and padding). In practice, wrapper elements are often used with LightDOM children, `<content>` and/or [`<slot>`](https://webkit.org/blog/4096/introducing-shadow-dom-api/) to form a composed DOM.
  
Although in a web app, it is ideal to build blackbox elements; in designing a Drupal theme, it is more common that you would work with wrapper elements.
